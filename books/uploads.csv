  I'm Ellen Arizona, and I'm a murderer.  I know you've heard my name. They're all talking about what I've done. But no one really understands why I did it. And no one understands me.  Except for the other killers at Cain University.  The Cain graduate program for killers is the only safe place left for me. But it comes with a catch: leave, and the consequences are deadly.  I need to stay. I have powers to train, and someone to kill next: the man who murdered my mother in cold blood. To get him, though, I'll need to survive the first year program.  Easier said than done. Especially when I find out the four men I loathe, who hunted me and petitioned to kill me, are somehow connected to my powers. If we don't learn to get along, it could spell doom—for them and for me.  First Kill is a brand new university-age first in a series, similar to The Magicians and Villain Academy. It has blood, gore, mature scenes, laugh out loud comedy, and a reverse harem enemies-to-lovers romance that will scorch off the pages. For readers 18+ only; please read the trigger warning inside.

Now Pollan turns his sharp insight to the craft of building, as he recounts the process of designing and constructing a small one-room structure on his rural Connecticut property--a place in which he hoped to read, write and daydream, built with his two own unhandy hands.Invoking the titans of architecture, literature and philosophy, from Vitrivius to Thoreau, from the Chinese masters of feng shui to the revolutionary Frank Lloyd Wright, Pollan brilliantly chronicles a realm of blueprints, joints and trusses as he peers into the ephemeral nature of ""houseness"" itself. From the spark of an idea to the search for a perfect site to the raising of a ridgepole, Pollan revels in the infinitely detailed, complex process of creating a finished structure. At once superbly written, informative and enormously entertaining, A Place of My Own is for anyone who has ever wondered how the walls around us take shape--and how we might shape them ourselves.A Place of My Own recounts his two-and-a-half-year journey of discovery in an absorbing narrative that deftly weaves the day-to-day work of design and building--from siting to blueprint, from the pouring of foundations to finish carpentry--with reflections on everything form the power of place to shape our lives to the question of what constitutes ""real work"" in a technological society.A book about craft that is itself beautifully crafted, linking the world of the body and material things with the realm of mind, heart, and spirit, A Place of My Own has received extraordinary praise.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386920202i/13838.jpg,local,"upload\Michael Pollan\Michael_Pollan_-_A_Place_of_My_Own-Penguin_USA,_Inc._(2008).epub",0,0,,,0,1

Today, he finds himself in another bitter, divisive presidential race but without the buzzwords. Instead, an embattled president struggles with a dysfunctionally divided Congress, the controversial healthcare bill, a decade-long war, and a stagnant economy.Obama’s Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, former corporate tycoon and former governor of Massachusetts,  faces his own controversies in the form of vague policies, fluctuating positions, and questions about his business practices in the private sector. Romney’s personal fortune and business background seemed at odds with the Republican base until he named Wisconsin congressman, Tea Party darling and fiscal conservative Paul Ryan as his running mate.Using sources deep inside both campaigns and on the campaign trail through primary and battleground states, Washington Post correspondent Dan Balz writes with a keen political mind and a seasoned reporter’s ear. He traces the highs and lows of the Obama presidency as well as the ruthless Republican primary as both laid the groundwork for one of the most crucial, contentious elections of our time.

It’s the dead of winter, and the Terrans hold the line as the Conglomeration is holed-up in a makeshift camp, prickly with nervous excitement, preparing for a massive offensive into wealthy Merriton—the gaudy Conglomerate city in which Sal was enslaved as a child. But the next battle will have to wait. Sometimes, things even more personal than war get in the way—like hormones.   Unimaginably powerful Salryc Luxx, Kaisae of all Iliri and de facto Queen of the Conglomerate forces, is finally brought to her knees—by ovulation. So is Shade, her partbred iliri warrior-sister. To avoid hormonal confusion, and, well, the entire Black Blades from instinctively tearing each other and all other male allies apart with protective rage and sexual prowess, all parties are separated—iliri from humans, men from women, Sal from her pack—stuck in a holding pattern while the battle lines move closer. And nobody is more annoyed by being cooped up with nothing to do than Sal.  When the women finally free themselves from self-imposed quarantine (and reforge their sexual bonds with their mates), it’s back to work. The allies continue to collaborate, this time enacting a meticulously-laid plan to quietly infiltrate Terric’s diamond of a city as spies. Part of the fun in this volume is the detailed unfolding of the riveting military plot, which has all the thrills of a Russian spy novel.  Like all of the Rise of the Iliri novels, this epic fantasy story focuses on loving relationships, platonic and romantic, with a steamy reverse harem theme. Sal’s erotic love scenes with her three male mates are explicit and almost unbearably titillating, although not for all readers—especially those under eighteen.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1537452314i/41951502.jpg,local,upload\Auryn Hadley\Upheaval_-_Auryn_Hadley.epub,0,0,,,0,1

She’s the last member of a cursed and deadly clan. He’s the crown prince with a dangerous secret. Together, they’ll save the empire. Or destroy it.  Decades ago, the High King of Sundolia waged a war that vanquished the serpent clan and drove them out of the empire, reducing them to nothing more than legends spoken of in occasional frightened whispers.  But they did not leave peacefully. Their parting gift included curses that now rest within the empire’s soil, beneath the shade of its jungles, treading through the waves of its seas. Growing more and more dormant as the years pass under the shadow of that increasingly tyrannical high king.  Until Alaya—a girl with a hidden serpent mark who shouldn’t exist—accidentally wakes one of them up. Then another. And suddenly she finds herself near universally despised and feared, a scapegoat exiled from her adopted village and left with no choice but to seek the truth about her cursed bloodline. About her true home. About a power, stolen from the serpent goddess herself, that is supposedly resting in that home. It is the sort of power that could help her overthrow a king, expose the lies he’s told, and put a stop to his wars.  But the closer she gets to that power, the more complicated the truth becomes. The more dangerous her waking power seems. And the more she begins to wonder: Can you still be the hero if you were born a curse?",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563832809l/50006930.jpg,local,upload\S.M.

The characteristic heart and punch-packing observations are back, but with a newfound coat of maturity. A thin coat. More of a blazer, really.Fans of I Was Told There'd Be Cake and How Did You Get This Number know Sloane Crosley's life as a series of relatable but madcap misadventures. In Look Alive Out There, whether it's scaling active volcanoes, crashing shivas, playing herself on Gossip Girl, befriending swingers, or staring down the barrel of the fertility gun, Crosley continues to rise to the occasion with unmatchable nerve and electric one-liners. And as her subjects become more serious, her essays deliver not just laughs but lasting emotional heft and insight. Crosley has taken up the gauntlets thrown by her predecessors―Dorothy Parker, Nora Ephron, David Sedaris―and crafted something rare, affecting, and true.Look Alive Out There arrives on the tenth anniversary of I Was Told There'd be Cake, and Crosley's essays have managed to grow simultaneously more sophisticated and even funnier. And yet she's still very much herself, and it's great to have her back―and not a moment too soon (or late, for that matter).",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509467062i/34888942.jpg,local,upload\Sloane Crosley\Look_Alive_Out_There.epub,0,0,,,0,1

Knowing how the horrifying events that took place while filming Project Demon Hunters shook his friend Michael Covenant to the core, Will Gordon readily says yes to Michael’s request to be ready — as a friend and as an Episcopal priest — in case psychic Rosemary McGuire calls for help.Rosemary doesn’t know exactly why the show was canceled...other than a demon murdered the show’s producer, and the network buried every scrap of harrowing footage under a ton of hacker-proof security.When an independent filmmaker shows up at Rosemary’s metaphysical bookshop with tantalizing clues that a backup copy of the missing footage exists, she promises Michael she’ll call some crusty old priest “in a pinch,” and begins following a trail of impossibly tiny bread crumbs.But that trail doesn’t just lead her somewhere. It leads something to Rosemary, alarming enough that she calls Michael’s priest friend…who turns out to be way younger and heroically handsome than she could have ever anticipated.

Her latest thriller, Unseen, pits detectives, lovers, and enemies against one another in an unforgettable standoff between righteous courage and deepest evil. Will Trent is a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent whose latest case has him posing as Bill Black, a scary ex-con who rides a motorcycle around Macon, Georgia, and trails an air of violence wherever he goes. The cover has worked and he has caught the eye of a wiry little drug dealer who thinks he might be a useful ally. But undercover and cut off from the support of the woman he loves, Sara Linton, Will finds his demons catching up with him. Although she has no idea where Will has gone, or why, Sara herself has come to Macon because of a cop shooting: Her stepson, Jared, has been gunned down in his own home. Sara holds Lena, Jared’s wife, responsible: Lena, a detective, has been a magnet for trouble all her life, and Jared’s shooting is not the first time someone Sara loved got caught in the crossfire.

He sees himself as successful and well-respected, but I see him as a womanizer without the ability to love. We don't agree on my future, so he throws a Halloween party and tells me I can choose any suitor from the party. I reluctantly go, but what neither of us expected, was Mr. Mysterious. He shows up out of nowhere, steals my heart, and leaves me with a choice. One path leads to happily ever after and the other leads to the scandal of the century. I make my choice, but what happens when the two paths converge again?  Eli To say that my stepfather is evil would be an understatement. When he prohibits me from something, it just makes me want it more, consequences be damned. So when Trevor tells me I can't go to the upscale, elite Halloween party being thrown by one of the New York Elite, I know I have to go. What I don't expect is for my revenge plan to go off the rails when I meet the one girl with the power to make me bend my knee.

It's the middle of the night. Prosecutor Alexandra Cooper is called to Harlem's Mount Neboh Baptist Church, a beautiful house of worship originally built as a synagogue. But the crowd gathered there isn't interested in architecture, or even prayer. They've come for the same reason Alex has: to find out why the body of a young woman has been decapitated, set on fire, and left burning on the church steps.  The only identifiable artifact on the charred remains is the imprint of a Star of David necklace seared into the victim's flesh. Alex wonders if the fire was meant to destroy this woman's body, or to draw attention to it. Her fears are confirmed days later, when a second corpse is found at a cathedral in Little Italy. The killings look like serial hate crimes, but the apparent differences in the victims' beliefs seem to eliminate a religious motive. Convinced that another young woman is bound to die, Alex mines the depths of Manhattan's many houses of worship to find a connection between the victims-and in the process uncovers a terrible and perilous truth that takes her far beyond the scope of her investigation, and directly into the path of terrible danger.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388438425i/8853981.jpg,local,upload\Linda Fairstein\Silent_Mercy_-_Linda_Fairstein.epub,0,0,,,0,1

These include Rhunis the Dragon Slayer, the young Tarren, the fearless Dwarf Roakore, the beguiling warrior Elf Avriel, and the powerful Zerafin.

Detective Alex Cross must confront his most terrifying nemesis ever-and his own deepest fears-in this electrifying new thriller from the master of suspense, James Patterson.
Alex Cross has never believed in vampires. But when two joggers are found slain in a manner that suggests a macabre ritual, he has to reconsider. Someone believes in vampires enough to have committed a series of bizarre murders that appear to be the work of one. Local police are horrified, and even the FBI is baffled.Cross takes on the case and plunges into a netherworld of secret clubs and role-players, a world full of poseurs and playactors-and someone demented enough to have crossed the line from dark ritual to real blood. At the same time, a lethal super-criminal from Cross's past known as the Mastermind is stalking him, taunting him, and threatening everything he holds dear. Cross has never been closer to defeat, or in greater danger. In a shocking conclusion, Alex Cross must survive a deadly confrontation-only to discover at last the awful secret of the Mastermind.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440196942i/79379.jpg,local,upload\James Patterson\Violets_Are_Blue_-_James_Patterson.epub,0,0,,,0,1

34466819,1,3,19472,Free,The Spark,"NEW STANDALONE NOVEL BY SF MASTER DAVID DRAKE. In a violent world in which civilization has fallen and monsters roam, a young hero will rise.In the time of the Ancients the universe was united—but that was so far in the past that not even memory remains, only the broken artifacts that a few Makers can reshape into their original uses. What survives is shattered into enclaves—some tiny, some ruined, some wild. Into the gaps between settlements, and onto the Road that connects all human reality and the reality that is not human and may never have been human, have crept monsters. Some creatures are men, twisted into inhuman evil; some of them are alien to Mankind— And there are things which are hostile to all life, things which will raven and kill until they are stopped. A Leader has arisen, welding the scattered human settlements together in peace and safety and smashing the enemies of order with an iron fist. In his capital, Dun Add, the Leader provides law and justice. In the universe beyond, his Champions advance—and enforce—the return of civilization. Pal, a youth from the sticks, has come to Dun Add to become a Champion. Pal is a bit of a Maker, and in his rural home he's been able to think of himself as a warrior because he can wield the weapons of the Ancient civilization. Pal has no idea of what he's really getting into in Dun Add. On the other hand, the Leader and Dun Add have no real idea of what might be inside this hayseed with high hopes.

Curt Wilcox knew old cars, and he knew immediately that this one was . . . wrong, just wrong. A few hours later, when Rafferty vanished, Wilcox and his fellow troopers knew the car was worse than dangerous – and that it would be better if John Q. Public never found out about it.Curt’s avid curiosity took the lead, and they investigated as best they could, as much as they dared.

This series can be enjoyed on its own, but readers of the Nora Jacobs books will be more familiar with the world and its characters. As a fox shifter, Shayne Davies gets no respect in an underworld run by the fearsome and powerful—werewolves and vampires, sorcerers, demons, and mythical faerie creatures.

Her mom constantly nags; her intended (but unwanted) mate ensures plenty of awkward silences, and Shayne is even expected to act submissive to the pack’s future alpha…a six year old. Yeah. Time for Plan B. All Shayne wants is to prove that she’s got what it takes to run with the big dogs, which is why she is constantly hounding Nick Gorgeous to make her an agent at the “Double D”, the Detroit Division of the FUA. That’s an easy “No” for Gorgeous, who keeps a strict “No Shayne Davies” policy. Well, never say never. When mysterious underworld criminals steal a load of bomb materials, the FUA picks up a messy case nobody wants to touch. It’s bad enough that a demon horde is involved, but now the annoying FBI has sent out an agent to babysit the investigation. To make matters worse, the notoriously uncooperative master vampire Henry Stadther has control over what may be the only key to breaking the a handsome human detective.

What makes Him unique? And what does He ask of those who submit to His teachings? In the spirit of his Pulitzer Prize-winning God, a trailblazing ""biography"" of the protagonist of the Old Testament, and Christ, his brilliant portrait of biblical Jesus, acclaimed religious scholar Jack Miles undertakes to answer these questions with his characteristic perspicacity, intelligence, and command of the subject. Miles depicts a ""character"" less mercurial than Yahweh, less ready to forgive than Christ, and yet emphatically part of their traditions. God in the Qur'an revises and perfects: His purpose is to make whole what had been corrupted or lost from the practices and scriptures of the earlier Abrahamic religions. Setting passages from the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Qur'an side by side, Miles illuminates what is unique about Allah, His teachings and His temperament, and in doing so revises that which is false, distorted, or simply absent from our conception of the heart of Islam. Miles writes, ""I hope [that by reading this book] you may find it a little easier to trust the Muslim next door, thinking of him as someone whose religion, after all, may not be so wildly unreasonable that someone holding to it could not be a trusted friend.""",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1530369927i/38819791.jpg,local,"upload\Jack Miles\Miles,_Jack_-_God_in_the_Qur'an-Knopf_Doubleday_Publishing_Group_(2018_2019).epub",0,0,,,0,1

Deva Rainsong was born with dragon fire in her veins, an ursa’s generous heart, a turul’s skill with song, and the carnal appetites of a nymph. What she wasn’t born with was a soul. It’s all she ever wanted, but the one thing she can never have.  When Fate was handing out those precious things, it must have overlooked her, and a soul is required to unlock the dormant elemental powers within her. Not to mention the only thing that will ever give her a chance of finding the thing she truly desires: a soul mate.  Not only has Fate forgotten her, it seems dead set on destroying the only part of her life that gives her purpose. An ancient bloodline of mixed-breed humans linked to Deva is being hunted by a pack of rogue fate hounds, and her link to the bloodline means she’s the only one who can save them.  She doesn’t count on her quest taking her straight into the arms of a dragon, and she definitely isn’t prepared for the futile desire he incites within her, or the frustrating passion his ursa friend draws out of her. She shouldn’t want the pair so much, but when they both fall victim to the hounds, it may take nothing less than her love to save them.

Meanwhile, back in the city, venators Ara Scott and Edon Marrok's investigation into a surge of Nephlim (those dangerous half-human, half demons) activity has come to a dead end. As quickly as they arrived, the Nephilim have all mysteriously disappeared from New York. Where did they go? And does the answer lie in the hidden caverns and remote glaciers of the Scandinavian peninsula? As the sun stretches summer days into white nights, the loyal crew encounters its most devastating trial yet, one that brings everything they believe into question and everything they love into danger.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524013329i/24396977.jpg,local,upload\Melissa de la Cruz\White_Nights_-_Melissa_de_la_Cruz.epub,0,0,,,0,1

Upon waking, he’s disoriented and scared…until he recognizes the scent of his old friend, Vane. Separated when Roland was sold and Vane wasn’t, Vane had since been rescued, and now offers the same freedom to Roland. With the force of Vane’s entire gargoyle clutch behind him, Roland finally feels like he can make a new start. Except, one of the gargoyles claims that they are mates, but Roland can’t sense it, revealing a secret he never wanted exposed.  Tobias is thrilled to discover that Roland is his mate until the lynx shifter denies their bond. When the pretty shifter declares he can’t bond with anyone—and Tobias learns the life-changing reason why—Tobias vows that it doesn’t matter to him. He’ll stand by and care for his mate through any difficulty.

Prince Honorious Jorg Ancrath vowed when he was nine to avenge his slaughtered mother and brother--and punish his father for not doing so. When he was fifteen, he began to fulfill that vow.

It's time to bring the pain, and Heavy Metal knows how to make that happen.

Born from the fertile imagination of bestselling author Michael Anderle…

What do you do when a mercenary team comes looking for trouble in your base... In your home?
There is a problem with Courtney's company and those that wish to have Courtney step down. Amanda and Anja are working on the base and have purchased an AI to help. Unfortunately, the AI had to be purchased after-market and already has a personality.
What do you do when a prurient AI is connected to a ton of guns all around your house?
Heavy Metal is fighting inside the ZOO and outside the ZOO. Is their ability to hide the bodies outside of the ZOO going to cause problems?There is a billionaire on one side and our team on the other.One side has money and access to guns, the other side has been matured in the ZOO. Does the billionaire even have a chance?
In the ZOO, you always expect the unexpected. Can Salinger keep his friendships afloat and stay out of the claws (or mouths) of the denizens of the ZOO AND the law this time?
Salinger Jacobs is working to build his company as fast as possible. Will he make a few mistakes he can't think his way out of?
Sometimes, you find that your best relationships come back.
NOTE:  There may or may not be gratuitous sex in this book. Or it might actually play into a later book with funny talk about men's vs. women's abilities and capabilities. There is ABSOLUTELY cursing in this book. LOTS of upset cursing, cursing out of anger, fear, and other emotional issues related to carnivorous alien flora or fauna eating humans who don’t say ‘darn.’ LOTS of gratuitous cursing just because the author finds it funny, too. There is death and sadness...and more death. In fact, it’s a blender of blood out in the ZOO. Man vs. Alien nature seems to justify ugly results. Plus, people have emotional hang-ups. Expect to smile, laugh, cry, and perhaps have a spate of jealousy or two. Further, there might be explicit sex, thank you sex, and you're welcome sex. Finally, there is no Coke in the ZOO.  That is probably the worst and most offensive trait in these stories. This is Michael Todd, and I approve of the shenanigans pulled within the ZOO stories.

Her boss thinks she is tenacious and ambitious; her friends think she is tough, stubborn, and maybe even a bit obsessed. And while Kate has made quite a name for herself for the past five years the only name she’s cared about is Nicolas Fox—an international crook she wants in more ways than one.              Audacious, handsome, and dangerously charming, Nicolas Fox is a natural con man, notorious for running elaborate scams on very high-profile people. At first he did it for the money. Now he does it for the thrill. He knows that the FBI has been hot on his trail—particularly Kate O’Hare, who has been watching his every move. For Nick, there’s no greater rush than being pursued by a beautiful woman . . . even one who aims to lock him up. But just when it seems that Nicolas Fox has been captured for good, he pulls off his greatest con of all: He convinces the FBI to offer him a job, working side by side with Special Agent Kate O’Hare. Problem is, teaming up to stop a corrupt investment banker who’s hiding on a private island in Indonesia is going to test O’Hare’s patience and Fox’s skill. Not to mention the skills of their ragtag team made up of flamboyant actors, wanted wheelmen, and Kate’s dad. High-speed chases, pirates, and Toblerone bars are all in a day’s work . . . if O’Hare and Fox don’t kill each other first.Praise for The Heist “ The Heist is the perfect title to carry on a trip to the beach.

DISASTER! THE BLACK BLADES DISBANDED, AN ALLIANCE IN TURMOIL... 
The intersecting worlds of the iliri, grauori, and men collide when an alliance is declared, and the humans renege. In the midst of offering an olive branch to other races, they seem secretly hellbent on destroying them all—and they begin by putting Sal on trial and disbanding the Black Blades. Auryn Hadley offers up deft commentary on racism between communities—melded with fantastical action-adventure in a world at war, and passionate erotic romance in this fourth installment of the Rise of the Iliri.True to its title, in Inseparable, on the world of Ogun, it’s the connections between all beings—human and otherwise—that will save or destroy them.Her recent mission a success, fearless (and irresistibly arousing) iliri warrior Lieutenant Salryc Luxx gets thanks in the form of imprisonment by the Conglomerate of Free Citizens. Sal’s not even sure what she’s accused of, but she suspects it’s the color of her pale skin—not her actions—that’s really on trial.Kinetry, an old comrade and ally of the Black Blades now forced to hold Sal, warns her that a rash of anti-iliri sentiment is sweeping Parliament and the military. In fact, it seems men don’t care for any race but their own. But Kinetry doesn’t know that the King of Anglia is on his way to the military stronghold. Nor does he know the King is bringing  with him thousands of grauori soldiers, members of a race of formerly hidden human-like wolves whose hunting and battle skills are unmatched.If the King arrives before Sal’s trial is resolved, he’ll learn something in the courtroom that may destroy all hope of the intended alliance. Torn between truth and treason, Sal must navigate political sensitivities to hold the three races together. And just when she seems to get somewhere, the Conglomeration disbands the Black Blades.The most psychologically complex and emotionally stirring of the Iliri tales, Inseparable delves deep into relationships: the connections between the iliri, grauori, and humans in increasingly uncertain and dangerous times, and the connections between comrades and lovers in all their grit and glory. Everyone knows Sal is irresistible to males, that’s part of what makes her such a brilliant assassin, but it’s her unbreakable devotion to her tribe that keep her alive—and the steamy interactions with her mates—old, new, and surprising—that keep the pages turning.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522547166i/39694303.jpg,local,upload\Auryn Hadley\Inseparable_-_Auryn_Hadley.epub,0,0,,,0,1

Sal needs to work on something that has bugged him from the beginning. 


His dissertation.


Born from the fertile imagination of bestselling author Michael Anderle…
There is a group engaging four new mercenaries, prepping them with simulated operations in the ZOO.
How come? 
Courtney has approved a new member of her team in California and Sal isn't sure it was a good idea.
This time, there is another group learning what it takes to plunder the ZOO. Can they live through it?
Salinger Jacobs is working to build his company as fast as possible. Will he make mistakes he can't think his way out of?
Sometimes, you find that your best relationships have your back.


NOTE:  There may or may not be gratuitous sex in this book. Or it might actually play into a later book with funny talk about men vs. women's abilities and capabilities. There is ABSOLUTELY cursing in this book. LOTS of upset cursing, cursing out of anger, fear, and other emotional issues related to carnivorous alien flora or fauna eating humans who don’t say ‘darn.’ LOTS of gratuitous cursing just because the author finds it funny, too. There is death and sadness...and more death. In fact, it’s a blender of blood out in the ZOO. Man vs. Alien nature seems to justify ugly results. Plus, people have emotional hang-ups. Expect to smile, laugh, cry, and perhaps have a spate of jealousy or two. Further, there might be explicit sex, thank you sex, and you're welcome sex. Finally, there is no Coke in the ZOO.  That is probably the worst and most offensive trait in these stories. This is Michael Todd, and I approve of the shenanigans pulled within the ZOO stories.

No way will I bow to any villain, no matter how brutally alluring. They can turn on the charm or tear me down, but they can’t break me, even if I can barely get my magic working.  They’ve never met anyone like me before. I don’t care about ruling. I just want to avenge the people I loved.  It doesn’t matter what kind of power runs through my veins. I’m taking Villain Academy down.  *Cruel Magic is the first in a university-age paranormal academy series. Expect magical villainy, a tough heroine who bends to no one’s will, a dollop of steam, and a slow-burn reverse harem romance where there'll be no choosing required.*  ",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1556054751i/45281803.jpg,local,upload\Eva Chase\Cruel_Magic_-_Eva_Chase.epub,0,0,,,0,1
67996,1,3,656983,Free,The Peoples of Middle-Earth,"When J.R.R. Tolkien laid aside The Silmarillion in 1937 the extension of the originall 'mythology' into later Ages of the world had scarcely begun. It was in the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings that there emerged a comprehensive historical structure and chronology of the Second and Third Ages, embracing all the diverse strands that came together in the War of the Ring. The difficulty that he found in providing these Appendices, leading to the delay in the publication of The Return of the King, is well known, but in The Peoples of Middle-earth Christopher Tolkien shows that early forms of these works already existed years before, in essays and records differing greatly from the published forms. He traces the evolution of the Calendars, the Hobbit genealogies, the Westron language or Common Speach (from which many words and names are recorded that were afterwards lost), and the chronological structure of the later Ages.Other writings by J.R.R. Tolkien are included in this final volume of The History of MIddle-earth, chiefly deriving from his last years, when new insights and new constructions still freely arose as he pondered the history that he had created. This book concludes with two soon-abandoned stories, both unique in the setting of time and place: The New Shadow in Gondor of the Fourth Age, and the tale of Tal-elmar, in which the coming of the dreaded Númenórean ships is seen through the eyes of men of Middle-earth in the Dark Years.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365256168i/67996.jpg,local,upload\J.R.R.

Maroboodus is not alone in his malcontent. Competition for survival and glory is a brutal, daily struggle. Life is harsh indeed for the tribes of the north and while god Woden's people, the troubled Goth nations have spread south and east from the islands of Gothonia, surging over the sea Rome calls Mare Gothonia to find new homes, the family of Maroboodus has taken dangerous lands in the east, pushing the old tribes of the Svea from the coasts. There, death by spear and hunger is part of daily life. The tribes of Maroboodus, led by the mighty Friednot and Hughnot of the Goths, live by the Long-Lake, enduring Saxon raids and Svea hostility. Only family ties and wise alliances can help them, because even the Thiuda of the noblest of the ancient Goth families, their old relative the Boat-Lord, resent and fear those who would build something on their own. Alliances get strained when high lords die, and old grudges will risk everything when the tribes should remain strong and united. In such a time, the troubled Maroboodus finds his patience and endurance sorely tested by another injustice after a victorious battle, and seeks to change the fortunes of their family, even against the wishes of his father, Hulderic. He does so by allying with their nemesis, hoping to grasp a high-born woman as his own and to bring glory to his name and family. Will the boldness of Maroboodus change the fate of the squabbling, threatened Goths, or plunge them, and Maroboodus, whose blood is plagued by an ancient curse of Lok, into the arms of their enemies? In this historical fiction adventure story of ancient Germania, we embark on the road of the trials of Maroboodus the Goth, as he eventually becomes one of the mightiest Germani kings.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459458635i/29557253.jpg,local,upload\Alaric Longward\Maroboodus_-_Alaric_Longward.epub,0,0,,,0,1

These narrative threads wind sinuously across a vast, richly detailed tapestry of the violent, sensual world of vampirism, taking us back 6,000 years to its beginnings.  As the stories of the ""first brood"" of blood drinkers are revealed, we are swept across the ages, from Egypt to South America to the Himalayas to all the shrouded corners of the globe where vampires have left their mark. Vampires are created--mortals succumbing to the sensation of ""being emptied, of being devoured, of being nothing."" Vampires are destroyed.  Dark rituals are performed--the rituals of ancient creatures prowling the modern world.  And, finally, we are brought to a moment in the twentieth century when, in an astonishing climax, the fate of the living dead--and perhaps of the living, all the living--will be decided.From the Hardcover edition.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327871992i/43758.jpg,local,upload\Anne Rice\The_Queen_of_the_Damned_-_Anne_Rice.epub,0,0,,,0,1

Kaitlyn Parker has no problem being the invisible girl, which is why she finds herself hiding in various cabinets and closets all over her college campus.

How do we get her back? The answer to the first is layered, the repercussions of it no one can fully foresee. The second answer is probably a given considering how kickass Sera is. Though she can’t do it alone and the one who comes to help wasn’t who most would think. Especially because it’s not a simple rescue. At. All. Months have passed when she returns home, and only her training with the FBI and going undercover saves her from too much crashing down on her at once. Oh yeah, and she’s still dying. They don’t know how she’s still alive when her own body was eating itself to survive. The road to recovery will be difficult, but she has help, and she does the best she can, especially when betrayal hits her hard from a place she hoped it wouldn’t. Thankfully all that work she put into building a solid foundation for herself pays off because the paranormals of Chicago will need to pull together or everything they built could be lost.  Seraphine Thomas is a crime series filled with Chicago attitude and a strong heroine that pushes what most would think a female lead capable of, along with the heat being involved with several men brings while trying to figure out what she wants.

This time, nothing is taken for granted except the ZOO will do what it always does, kill people.


NOTE:  There may or may not be gratuitous sex in this book. Or it might actually play into a later book with funny talk about men vs. women's abilities and capabilities. There is ABSOLUTELY cursing in this book. LOTS of upset cursing, cursing out of anger, fear, and other emotional issues related to carnivorous alien flora or fauna eating humans who don’t say ‘darn.’ LOTS of gratuitous cursing just because the author finds it funny, too. There is death and sadness...and more death. In fact, it’s a blender of blood out in the ZOO. Man vs. Alien nature seems to justify ugly results. Plus, people have emotional hang-ups. Expect to smile, laugh, cry, and perhaps have a spate of jealousy or two. Further, there might be explicit sex, thank you sex, and you're welcome sex. Finally, there is no Coke in the ZOO.  That is probably the worst and most offensive trait in these stories. This is Michael Todd, and I approve of the shenanigans pulled within the ZOO stories.

The Gods Are Back in Town!


Well, to be precise, they never left...


Just because people stopped believing in them, didn't make them disappear, and Hades, Apollo, Ares, Poseidon, and Zeus are all as about town as they ever were. They just have different names...
Ziel Dearil is the God of the dead and the King of the Underworld. With his guardians at his side, demi-god Orpheus, and hero Icarus, he's been ruling his rather boring realm with an iron fist since time began!


Then, everything changes when Cressida Jonas walks into their world!


When Hades informs the multi-platinum-selling, multi award-winning singer that she's his wife, any normal woman might have run screaming for the hills. Cressida, on the other hand, sees this as an opportunity to get revenge on the man who wronged her eighteen months ago!
Falling for three guys was never a part of the program, just vengeance. But of course, the Fates have a way of messing with the best laid plans!

See what they have in store for Cressida, Hades, Icarus, and Orpheus in HOTTER THAN HADES!

PRAGUE, 1870.
For the last ten years, nineteen-year-old Eleanora Svobodová has worked as a servant in her stepmother's household. Along with her older brother, she dreams of the day they will be free to live life on their own terms.But everything changes when their estranged grandmother comes to Prague on behalf of Queen Victoria. Throughout Bohemia, a string of murders and secret whispers hint at a larger coup. As the leader of the Order of the Crystal Daggers, an ancient order of spies and soldiers that protect kingdoms and their rulers, Lady Penelope is determined to discover the perpetrators. Now, Eleanora must make the choice between a life of intrigue and saving the lives of others.Can Eleanora find a way do the right thing and still find freedom?
FROM THE BOOK: 

“I want to be free.” The words came rushing out of me before I could think through their implications and consequences.

“There are two things you need to know about yourself if you want to be free—what you stand for, and what you stand against.” Lady Penelope held up her hands, brandishing a pair of daggers that had been hidden in her skirts. “This world lives enslaved to its destruction, and so long as you are living, as long as you are fighting, you will be free.”

I gazed at the daggers, transfixed. Each blade was clothed in a leather scabbard, but the silver and obsidian of the daggers’ hilts winked at me, as though it was calling for me.


FROM THE AUTHOR: 
With a fun blend of historical fiction, true love, castle intrigue, and family dysfunction, The Order of the Crystal Daggers is my latest adventure series!

I recommend to anyone who can stomach real life situations.”– Amazon review ”Non-stop action, good story. Difficult to put down” – Amazon review Hraban has become his father. Like Maroboodus, Hraban serves Rome. He has made oaths to Armin the Cherusci, but is really trying to find a way to destroy him. Through that dark service, Hraban seeks a pedestal so high in the Roman hierarchy, that it shall forever keep his family safe from harm. No matter the cost to Germania, to his honour, and to his friends, he is determined to make sure Tiberius will be, and will remain the new Augustus, and that Armin shall fall, as will Germanicus, the great rival of Tiberius. This service will guarantee Hraban immunity from his many enemies. No matter the cost, he will make sure none would ever threaten his son Gervas. The cost had already been high. His friends have abandoned him. Worse, Germanicus has had Cassia killed. The man’s revenge has ripped Hraban’s heart out. He would go on for his son. All he had to do was to sell what remains of his soul. And yet, Hraban wasn’t his father. Unlike Maroboodus, the Bear, the Raven was slowly healing, and he was seeking a way out of his darkness. But nothing is ever simple in the world of Rome and Germania, for even Armin is changing, and Tiberius is slowly growing mad. Perfect for those who love the stories of Bernard Cornwell, Colleen McCullough, Simon Scarrow, and Griff Hosker, the Hraban Chronicles will take you on an incredible and authentic road through the ancient Roman Empire and into the secretive court of Augustus and Tiberius. We will be following Hraban’s relentless pursuit for the truth behind the deaths of his family, and for the causes of his misfortune.

The Devil's Punchbowl reveals a world of depravity, sex, violence, and the corruption of a Southern town. As a prosecuting attorney in Houston, Penn Cage sent hardened killers to death row. But it is as mayor of his hometown -- Natchez, Mississippi -- that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from Gone With the Wind.But one boat isn't like the others.Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them -- on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night -- come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing: blood sport -- and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor: Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in The Quiet Can Game and lost in Turning Angel Danny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from  Tom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physician Walt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War.Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate -- and counter -- their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead -- and Natchez changed forever.After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero. Rich with Southern atmosphere and marked by one jaw-dropping plot turn after another, The Devil's Punchbowl confirms that Greg Iles is America's master of suspense.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421371209i/2967316.jpg,local,upload\Greg Iles\The_Devil's_Punchbowl_-_Greg_Iles.epub,0,0,,,0,1

He raises Ava as a daughter, leaving only occasionally to help Archangel Michael fight demons and protect other humans.  Archangel Michael calls for his help when Zacharias is trying to help protect Ava and the humans that she loves.

Will he manage to save them all, or will someone be lost? ~~~~~Divided Paths can be read as book 4 in the Afterlife series, or can also be read as a stand alone book, or before book 1: Fledgling.~~~~~“When Zacharias is assigned to protect a young human child, he never dreams how his life will change as a result.

2675261,1,3,9629,Free,The Gypsy Morph,"Terry Brooks won instant acclaim with his phenomenal New York Times bestseller The Sword of Shannara. Its sequels earned Brooks legendary status. Then his darkly enthralling The Word and the Void trilogy revealed new depths and vistas to his mastery of epic fantasy. Armageddon’s Children and The Elves of Cintra took Brooks’s remarkable mythos to a breathtaking new level by delving deep into the history of Shannara. And now, The Gypsy Morph rounds out–with an adventure of unforgettably imaginative scope–the first phase of a new chapter in this classic series. Eighty years into the future, the United States is a no-man’s-land: its landscape blighted by chemical warfare, pollution, and plague; its government collapsed; its citizens adrift, desperate, fighting to stay alive. In fortified compounds, survivors hold the line against wandering predators, rogue militias, and hideous mutations spawned from the toxic environment, while against them all stands an enemy neither mortal nor merciful: demons and their minions bent on slaughtering and subjugating the last of humankind. But from around the country, allies of good unite to challenge the rampaging evil. Logan Tom, wielding the magic staff of a Knight of the Word, has a promise to keep–protecting the world’ s only hope of salvation–and a score to settle with the demon that massacred his family. Angel Perez, Logan’s fellow Knight, has risked her life to aid the elvish race, whose peaceful, hidden realm is marked for extermination by the forces of the Void. Kirisin Belloruus, a young elf entrusted with an ancient magic, must deliver his entire civilization from a monstrous army. And Hawk, the rootless boy who is nothing less than destiny’s instrument, must lead the last of humanity to a latter-day promised land before the final darkness falls.  The Gypsy Morph is an epic saga of a world in flux as the mortal realm yields to a magical one; as the champions of the Word and the Void clash for the last time to decide what will be and what must cease; and as, from the remnants of a doomed age, something altogether extraordinary rises.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420943855i/2675261.jpg,local,upload\Terry Brooks\The_Gypsy_Morph_-_Terry_Brooks.epub,0,0,,,0,1

Stewart's newsbreaking investigation of our era's most high-profile perjurers, revealing the alarming extent of this national epidemic.Our system of justice rests on a simple that witnesses will raise their hands and tell the truth. In Tangled Webs , James B. Stewart reveals in vivid detail the consequences of the perjury epidemic that has swept our country, undermining the very foundation of our courts.With many prosecutors, investigators, and participants speaking for the first time, Tangled Webs goes behind the scene of the trials of media and homemaking entrepreneur Martha Stewart; top White House political adviser Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby; home-run king Barry Bonds; and Wall Street money manager Bernard Madoff.The saga of Martha Stewart's conviction captured the nation, but until now no one has answered the most basic Why would Stewart risk prison, put her entire empire in jeopardy, and lie repeatedly to government investigators to save a few hundred thousand dollars in stock gains? Moreover, how exactly was the notoriously meticulous Stewart brought down?Drawing on the accounts of then-deputy attorney general James Comey and U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, Stewart sheds new light on the Libby investigation, making clear how far into the White House the Valerie Plame CIA scandal extended, and why Libby took the fall.In San Francisco, Giants home-run king Barry Bonds faces trial due to his testimony before a grand jury investigating the use of illegal steroids in sports. Bonds was warned explicitly that the only crime he faced was perjury. Stewart unlocks the story behind the mounting evidence that he nonetheless lied under oath.Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme is infamous, but less well known is how he eluded detection for so long in the face of repeated investigations. Of the four he is the only one who has admitted to lying.The perjury outbreak is symptomatic of a broader breakdown of ethics in American life. It isn't just the judicial system that relies on an honor Academia, business, medicine, and government all depend on it. Tangled Webs explores the age-old tensions between greed and justice, self-interest and public interest, loyalty and duty. At a time when Americans seem hungry for moral leadership and clarity, Tangled Webs reaffirms the importance of truth.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327640110i/9754472.jpg,local,upload\James B.

The high fae council saw that the balance of good and evil had been tipped too far in one direction and it had to be rectified. So they killed all of the witches, and their creator… or so they thought. But they were wrong. Volcan, the high fae, who had once been a member of their council, until he decided he wanted to be all-powerful and created the witches, had bided his time, hiding in the Dark Forest. Now he’s back and hell-bent on rebuilding his army of witches. Only this time he’s set his eyes on the gypsy healers to be the tool from which he creates them. He already has two of the newly found healers, Jewel and Anna, with his blood running in their veins. And though he thinks he’s got it all planned out, what Volcan hadn’t calculated into his formula of healers + his blood = witches, was the healer’s mates, Dalton and Gustavo. Both males are more than ready to sink their teeth into the high fae who has taken their females. With the darkness closing in on all four of them, it is a toss-up as to who will succumb to it first.Meanwhile, the healers and wolves Peri had stashed in the pixie realm are sitting ducks with the Veil between them and the human realm locked. The mates of those healers are holding onto their self-control by a thread as they try to figure out a way to get them out of the pixie realm. Perizada is once again fighting for those who are under her protection, while at the same time trying not to kill them herself. Considering the healers tend to do stupid heroic stuff and the wolves just do stupid stuff period, it’s not certain who will destroy who. The only thing that was certain; none of them was willing to surrender. Throw in a powerful, eccentric Djinn who has suddenly gotten bored and things are guaranteed to get messy. This is the continuation of the story of the five gypsy healers, the fae who protects them, and the wolves whose wrath will consume any who come between them.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506646468i/36321663.jpg,local,upload\Quinn Loftis\Wolves_of_Wrath_-_Quinn_Loftis.epub,0,0,,,0,1

6366437,1,20,3275,Free,Half Broke Horses,"Jeannette Walls's memoir The Glass Castle was ""nothing short of spectacular"" (Entertainment Weekly). Now, in Half Broke Horses, she brings us the story of her grandmother, told in a first-person voice that is authentic, irresistible, and triumphant. ""Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did."" So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, Jeannette Walls's no nonsense, resourceful, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town -- riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car (""I loved cars even more than I loved horses. They didn't need to be fed if they weren't working, and they didn't leave big piles of manure all over the place"") and fly a plane. And, with her husband Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona. She raised two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle. Lily survived tornadoes, droughts, floods, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds -- against women, Native Americans, and anyone else who didn't fit the mold. Rosemary Smith Walls always told Jeannette that she was like her grandmother, and in this true-life novel, Jeannette Walls channels that kindred spirit. Half Broke Horses is Laura Ingalls Wilder for adults, as riveting and dramatic as Isak Dinesen's Out of Africa or Beryl Markham's West with the Night.

But times change, even in the north, and in a tale woven with consummate artistry, people of all three cultures find the threads of their lives unexpectedly brought together...Bern Thorkellson, punished for his father's sins, commits an act of vengeance and desperation that brings him face-to-face, across the sea, with a past he's been trying to leave behind.In the Anglcyn lands of King Aeldred, the shrewd king, battling inner demons all the while, shores up his defenses with alliances and diplomacy-and with swords and arrows-while his exceptional, unpredictable sons and daughters pursue their own desires when battle comes and darkness falls in the woods.And in the valleys and shrouded hills of the Cyngael, whose voices carry music even as they feud and raid amongst each other, violence and love become deeply interwoven when the dragon ships come and Alun ab Owyn, chasing an enemy in the night, glimpses strange lights gleaming above forest pools.Making brilliant use of saga, song and chronicle, Kay brings to life an unforgettable world balanced on the knife-edge of change in The Last Light of the Sun.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408923778i/104080.jpg,local,upload\Guy Gavriel Kay\The_Last_Light_of_the_Sun_-_Guy_Gavriel_Kay.epub,0,0,,,0,1

Many years ago, two children from completely different worlds forged a connection, a fateful connection, an unbreakable bond that would change their lives forever… Salome knows only one way to live—under Prophet David’s rule. In the commune she calls home, Salome knows nothing of life beyond her strict faith, nor of life beyond the Fence—the fence that cages her, keeps her trapped in an endless cycle of misery. A life she believes she is destined to always lead, until a horrific event sets her free. Fleeing the absolute safety of all she has ever known, Salome is thrust into the world outside, a frightening world full of uncertainty and sin; into the protective arms of a person she believed she would never see again. River ‘Styx’ Nash knows one thing for certain in life—he was born and bred to wear a cut. Raised in a turbulent world of sex, Harleys, and drugs, Styx, unexpectedly has the heavy burden of the Hades Hangmen gavel thrust upon him, and all at the ripe old age of twenty-six—much to his rivals’ delight. Haunted by a crushing speech impediment, Styx quickly learns to deal with his haters. Powerful fists, an iron jaw and the skillful use of his treasured German blade has earned him a fearsome reputation as a man not to be messed with in the shadowy world of outlaw MC’s. A reputation that successfully keeps most people far, far away. Styx has one rule in life—never let anyone get too close. It’s a plan that he has stuck to for years, that is, until a young woman is found injured on his lot… a woman who looks uncannily familiar, a woman who clearly does not belong in his world, yet a woman he feels reluctant to let go… Dark Contemporary Romance/New Adult Novel.

5340,2,10,239579,Free,Pictures from Italy,"A delightful travelogue in the unique style of one of the greatest writers in the English languageIn 1844, Charles Dickens took a break from novel writing to travel through Italy for almost a year and Pictures from Italy is an illuminating account of his experiences there. He presents the country like a magic-lantern show, as vivid images ceaselessly appear before his - and his readers' - eyes. Italy's most famous sights are all to be found here - St Peter's in Rome, Naples with Vesuvius smouldering in the background, the fairytale buildings and canals of Venice - but Dickens's chronicle is not simply that of a tourist. Avoiding preconceptions and stereotypes, he portrays a nation of great between grandiose buildings and squalid poverty, and between past and present, as he observes everyday life beside ancient monuments. Combining thrilling travelogue with piercing social commentary, Pictures from Italy is a revealing depiction of an exciting and disquieting journey. In her introduction, Kate Flint discusses nineteenth-century travel writing, and Dickens's ideas about perception, memory and Italian politics. This edition also includes a chronology, further reading, notes and an appendix. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

A decorated knight for Richard the Lionheart and an ally of the House of de Lohr, Sir Garret de Moray was a man described as cold… intimidating… foreboding. A man with eyes as black as night.  Receiving a royal appointment as Captain of the Household Guard, there was no man more qualified or prepared for the role because on the sands of the Holy Land where Garret went on Richard’s great quest, the Christian armies whispered of a knight whose wisdom was ancient.

Instead of dying, however, she wakes up in a completely different body in the middle of a half-ruined castle during alternate medieval times. Confused and dismayed, Aliya realizes she was given a second chance in life — so she rolls up her sleeves and gets to work on restoring the castle and her new life. Aliya’s situation is confusing and challenging. Reborn as Countess Lilian Earton, she has to adjust to an unfamiliar world while trying to introduce everyday conveniences from the world she knows. Her first goal is taking care of the collapsing estate of Earton and its inhabitants — and learning to navigate a society unused to a woman in charge. Constant attacks of robbers and slave traders never seem to stop plaguing Aliya, and killers and spies sent by the narcissistic aristocracy are just waiting for her to show a bit of weakness so that they can strike, even if as she finds an alternative solution to her troubles, developing alliances with the Highlanders and Vikings called the Virmans. In the meantime, she is terrified with the prospect of finally meeting her perpetually absent husband whom, incidentally, Aliya has never seen ever since her rebirth as Lilian. Her plan is to make the best of her unusual circumstances — and to change this alternate world for the better.

13997,1,3,8685,Free,The Serpent's Shadow,"Mercedes Lackey returns to form in The Serpent's Shadow, the fourth in her sequence of reimagined fairy tales. This story takes place in the London of 1909, and is based on ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" Lackey creates echoes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, pays affectionate homage to Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey (who plays an important role under a thin disguise), and turns the dwarves into seven animal avatars who masquerade as pets of her Eurasian heroine, Maya.Some of Maya's challenges come from the fact that she is not ""snow white,"" and she has fled India for her father's English homeland after the suspicious deaths of her parents. Establishing her household in London, she returns to her profession as a physician, working among the poor. Her ""pets"" and loyal servants stand guard, and Maya herself uses what bits of magic she managed to pick up in childhood to weave otherworldly defenses as well. But the implacable enemy who killed her parents has come to London to search for her; if Maya can be enslaved, her enormous potential powers can be used to the enemy's ends. Fortunately, English magicians of the White Lodge have also noted a new, powerful presence in their midst, though they're having trouble locating her, too. They send Peter Scott, a Water Master, to track her down. He finds Maya beautiful and benign, and is determined to teach her to use the Western magic she is heir to, before her enemy discovers her.Some will find the author's Kiplingesque descriptions of India and Hindustani culture offensive. Lackey describes Maya's enemy as a powerful devotee of the goddess Kali-Durga, though she carefully shows that the avatars of the other deities will not attack her, and has Kali-Durga repudiate her servant in the climactic confrontation. And, though the story is layered, its surface is as glossy and brightly colored as an action comic. But readers who enjoy late Victorian London, Sayers, Sherlock Holmes stories, and a page-turning tale will want to take this one home. --Nona Vero",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1406635564i/13997.jpg,local,upload\Mercedes Lackey\The_Serpent's_Shadow_-_Mercedes_Lackey.epub,0,0,,,0,1

16062202,1,3,28946,Free,The Keepers,"Young Jan is stunned when his father, Cadell, the “zupan” and leader of the region’s villages, is offered the vassal lordship of the local keep. His father is about as far from nobility as anyone could be. For some reason, the nobles of the house of Äntes, the rulers of Jan’s province, have been unable to keep a vassal there for twenty years — as those appointed have fled the place in the night — and the Äntes may have grown desperate enough to throw the position at Jan’s father.The last place Jan wants to live is a decrepit, dark little fortress above a village of superstitious peasants. But when his father accepts the position, Jan finds himself swept off to the abandoned keep above the village of Chemestúk. The situation there is darker and more serious than he, his mother, or his father bargained for.The local peasants won’t go near the keep; something terrible happened up there twenty years ago. Soon enough, Jan and his mother begin to learn why no vassal has ever remained in that place for more than a moon. And the darkness upon the keep is greater than mere superstition.About ""Tales from the world of the Noble Dead Saga""...No knowledge of the Noble Dead Saga is necessary to read, comprehend, and enjoy any ""tale.""

Sometimes the good guys win and the bad guys end up dead. 

But that isn't how it always goes down. In the ZOO, you are either fast and lucky or you are dead.
Heavy Metal has a few videos that are out gaining attention in parts of the world, and that doesn't bode well for them.
Born from the fertile imagination of bestselling author Michael Anderle…

Some people are noticing that Sal and his team have someone extra-special working with them, and they want a piece of her…or all of her.
This time, it's back to basics for Heavy Metal with just Sal, Madigan, and Courtney. 
Are they enough to save their friend?

When the enemy is better than you, move to a fighting ground you have more experience in. The ZOO is agnostic—it will kill everyone it can.


NOTE:  There may or may not be gratuitous sex in this book. Or it might actually play into a later book with funny talk about men vs. women's abilities and capabilities. There is ABSOLUTELY cursing in this book. LOTS of upset cursing, cursing out of anger, fear, and other emotional issues related to carnivorous alien flora or fauna eating humans who don’t say ‘darn.’ LOTS of gratuitous cursing just because the author finds it funny, too. There is death and sadness...and more death. In fact, it’s a blender of blood out in the ZOO. Man vs. alien nature seems to justify ugly results. Plus, people have emotional hang-ups. Expect to smile, laugh, cry, and perhaps have a spate of jealousy or two. Further, there might be explicit sex, thank-you sex, and you're-welcome sex. Finally, there is no Coke in the ZOO.  That is probably the worst and most offensive trait in these stories. This is Michael Todd, and I approve of the shenanigans pulled within the ZOO stories.

12341557,1,3,3389,Free,The Wind Through the Keyhole,"Stephen King returns to the rich landscape of Mid-World, the spectacular territory of the Dark Tower fantasy saga that stands as his most beguiling achievement. Roland Deschain and his ka-tet—Jake, Susannah, Eddie, and Oy, the billy-bumbler—encounter a ferocious storm just after crossing the River Whye on their way to the Outer Baronies. As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange story but two . . . and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past. In his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his mother’s death, Roland is sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, a “skin-man” preying upon the population around Debaria. Roland takes charge of Bill Streeter, the brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beast’s most recent slaughter. Only a teenager himself, Roland calms the boy and prepares him for the following day’s trials by reciting a story from the Magic Tales of the Eld that his mother often read to him at bedtime. “A person’s never too old for stories,” Roland says to Bill. “Man and boy, girl and woman, never too old. We live for them.” And indeed, the tale that Roland unfolds, the legend of Tim Stoutheart, is a timeless treasure for all ages, a story that lives for us.King began the Dark Tower series in 1974; it gained momentum in the 1980s; and he brought it to a thrilling conclusion when the last three novels were published in 2003 and 2004. The Wind Through the Keyhole is sure to fascinate avid fans of the Dark Tower epic.

A video link lands in her text messages, immediately begins playing... and seems to be from her niece Lucy. But how can it be? It’s clearly a surveillance film of Lucy taken almost twenty years ago.As Scarpetta watches she comes to grips with frightening secrets about her niece, whom she loves like a daughter. That first clip and others sent soon after raise dangerous implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her confused, alarmed, and not knowing where to turn. She doesn’t know whom she can tell – not her FBI agent husband, Benton Wesley, or her investigative partner, Pete Marino. Not even Lucy.Cornwell launches these unforgettable characters on an intensely psychological odyssey that includes the bizarre death of a Hollywood mogul’s daughter, wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle, a grisly gift left in the back of a crime scene truck, and videos from the past that threaten to destroy Scarpetta’s entire world and everyone she loves. The diabolical presence and singularly ""depraved heart"" behind what unfolds seems obvious - but strangely, not to the FBI. Certainly that’s the message they send when they start harassing Lucy and begin building a case that could send her to prison for the rest of her life.In the latest novel in her bestselling series featuring medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell captivates readers again with the jolting twists, high-wire tension, and cutting-edge forensic detail for which she is renowned, proving yet again why she is the world’s number one bestselling crime writer.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439833245i/24903919.jpg,local,upload\Patricia Cornwell\Depraved_Heart_-_Patricia_Cornwell.epub,0,0,,,0,1

Maelgwn begins the arduous process of watching and waiting, searching for that perfect opportunity to make contact with his mate.Bobby Truman is tired of his boyfriend, Seth’s, abusive friends, especially when Seth doesn’t do anything about their antics. The broken nose, compliments of Seth’s buddy Grant, is the final straw. When he’s attacked by muggers and rescued by a mysterious stranger in the dark, Bobby hopes it’s the opportunity he needs to make a clean break from Seth. Even if it doesn’t work out with Maelgwn, maybe Bobby can keep his new love interest’s attention long enough to prove to Seth they are really done.Bobby thinks it’s odd that Maelgwn won’t come into the light, always meeting him after dark, but he’s nowhere near prepared for the truth when it finally comes out. Can Maelgwn convince Bobby that the things that go bump in the night aren’t always bad and to take his place at Maelgwn’s side in a paranormal world? Even when that means uprooting his life and moving?",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1359721110i/17312323.jpg,local,upload\Charlie Richards\Paranormal's_Love_11_-_Hot-Bloo_-_Charlie_Richards.epub,0,0,,,0,1
